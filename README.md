## The problem it solves

Meta health is a decentralised application that solves the problem of the harmful radiation released by mobile towers which are continuously growing in number. We store all the data on the Matic blockchain network by using <b>filecoin</b> so that data remains safe and trustworthy. The smart contract is deployed on <b>polygon</b> network.

The people who live near cell phone towers experience a range of problems like sleep disturbances, headaches, memory loss, lack of focus, weariness, joint problems, visual distortion, miscarriage, heart troubles and other symptoms that are due to being in contact with radiations, our website will inform them about the radiation levels in their neighbourhood and if the radiation is higher than the governments allowed limit then we make them aware about ways to report the high radiation to the respected authority.
